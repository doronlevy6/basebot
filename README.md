# Basebot

## Running the project

### Running gistbot + mailbot

1. Clone the mailbot repo in the same level with this repo (make sure to keep the mailbot name).
2. Read the secrets in both projects using `secrets:read`
3. Run `start:local` to start the docker compose
4. Run ngrok to open ports for both the slacker and mailbot.
